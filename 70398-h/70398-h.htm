<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="50" height="65" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There doesn’t seem much excuse for me, sitting
under a little cedar tree at the foot of the Rockies,
looking at the pale desert disappearing westward,
with hummocks of shadow rising in the stillness of incipient
autumn, this morning, the near pine trees perfectly
still, the sunflowers and the purple michaelmas daisies
moving for the first time, this morning, in an invisible
breath of breeze, to be writing an introduction to a bibliography.</p>

<p>Books to me are incorporate things, voices in the air,
that do not disturb the haze of autumn, and visions that
don’t blot out the sunflowers. What do I care for first or
last editions? I have never read one of my own published
works. To me, no book has a date, no book has a binding.</p>

<p>What do I care if “e” is somewhere upside down, or “g”
comes from the wrong fount? I really don’t.</p>

<p>And when I force myself to remember, what pleasure
is there in that? The very first copy of <i>The White Peacock</i>
that was ever sent out, I put into my mother’s hands
when she was dying. She looked at the outside, and then
at the title-page, and then at me, with darkening eyes.
And though she loved me so much, I think she doubted
whether it could be much of a book, since no-one more
important than I had written it. Somewhere, in the helpless
privacies of her being, she had wistful respect for me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
But for me in the face of the world, not much. This
David would never get a stone across at Goliath. And
why try? Let Goliath alone!—Anyway, she was beyond
reading my first immortal work. It was put aside, and I
never wanted to see it again. She never saw it again.</p>

<p>After the funeral, my father struggled through half a
page, and it might as well have been Hottentot.</p>

<p>“And what dun they gi’e thee for that, lad?”</p>

<p>“Fifty pounds, father.”</p>

<p>“Fifty pound!” He was dumbfounded, and looked at
me with shrewd eyes, as if I were a swindler. “Fifty
pound! An’ tha’s niver done a day’s hard work in thy
life.”</p>

<p>I think to this day, he looks upon me as a sort of cleverish
swindler, who gets money for nothing: a sort of Ernest
Hooley. And my sister says, to my utter amazement:
“You <i>always</i> were lucky!”</p>

<p>Somehow, it is the actual corpus and substance, the
actual paper and rag volume of any of my works, that
calls up these personal feelings and memories. It is the
miserable tome itself which somehow delivers me to the
vulgar mercies of the world. The voice inside is mine
forever. But the beastly marketable chunk of a published
volume is a bone which every dog presumes to pick with
me.</p>

<p>William Heinemann published <i>The White Peacock</i>. I
saw him once; and then I realized what an immense
favour he was doing me. As a matter of fact, he treated
me quite well.</p>

<p>I remember, at the last minute, when the book was all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
printed and ready to bind: some even bound: they sent me
in great haste a certain page with a marked paragraph.
Would I remove this paragraph, as it might be considered
“objectionable,” and substitute an exactly identical number
of obviously harmless words. Hastily I did so. And
later, I noticed that the two pages, on one of which was
the altered paragraph, were rather loose, not properly
bound in to the book.—Only my mother’s copy had the
paragraph unchanged.</p>

<p>I have wondered often if Heinemann’s just altered the
“objectionable” bit in the first little batch of books they
sent out, then left the others as first printed. Or whether
they changed all but the one copy they sent me ahead.</p>

<p>It was my first experience of the objectionable. Later,
William Heinemann said he thought <i>Sons and Lovers</i>
one of the dirtiest books he had ever read. He refused to
publish it.—I should not have thought the deceased gentleman’s
reading had been so circumspectly narrow.</p>

<p>I forget the first appearance of <i>The Trespasser</i> and
<i>Sons and Lovers</i>. I always hide the fact of publication
from myself as far as possible. One writes, even at this
moment, to some mysterious presence in the air. If that
presence were not there, and one thought of even a single
solitary actual reader, the paper would remain forever
white.</p>

<p>But I always remember how, in a cottage by the sea, in
Italy, I re-wrote almost entirely that play, <i>The Widowing
of Mrs. Holroyd</i>, right on the proofs which Mitchell
Kennerley had sent me. And he nobly forbore with me.</p>

<p>But then he gave me a nasty slap. He published <i>Sons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and Lovers</i> in America, and one day, joyful, arrived a
cheque for twenty pounds. Twenty pounds in those days
was a little fortune: and as it was a windfall, it was
handed over to Madame; the first pin-money she had seen.
Alas and alack, there was an alteration in the date of the
cheque, and the bank would not cash it. It was returned
to Mitchell Kennerley, but that was the end of it. He
never made good, and never to this day made any further
payment for <i>Sons and Lovers</i>. Till this year of grace
1924, America has had that, my most popular book, for
nothing—as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>Then came the first edition of <i>The Rainbow</i>. I’m
afraid I set my rainbow in the sky too soon, before, instead
of after the deluge. Methuen published that book, and
he almost wept before the magistrate, when he was summoned
for bringing out a piece of indecent literature. He
said he did not know the dirty thing he had been handling,
he had not read the work, his reader had misadvised him—and
<i>Peccavi! Peccavi!</i> wept the now be-knighted gentleman.
Then around me arose such a fussy sort of interest,
as when a really scandalous bit of scandal is being
whispered about one. In print my fellow-authors kept
scrupulously silent, lest a bit of the tar might stick to
them. Later Arnold Bennett and May Sinclair raised a
kindly protest. But John Galsworthy told me, very
calmly and ex cathedra, he thought the book a failure as a
work of art.—They think as they please. But why not
wait till I ask them, before they deliver an opinion to me?
Especially as impromptu opinions by elderly authors are
apt to damage him who gives as much as him who takes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>There is no more indecency or impropriety in <i>The
Rainbow</i> than there is in this autumn morning—I, who
say so, ought to know. And when I open my mouth, let
no dog bark.</p>

<p>So much for the first edition of <i>The Rainbow</i>. The
only copy of any of my books I ever keep is my copy of
Methuen’s <i>Rainbow</i>. Because the American editions have
all been mutilated. And this is almost my favourite
among my novels: this, and <i>Women in Love</i>. And I
should really be best pleased if it were never re-printed
at all, and only those blue, condemned volumes remained
extant.</p>

<p>Since <i>The Rainbow</i>, one submits to the process of publication
as to a necessary evil: as souls are said to submit to
the necessary evil of being born into the flesh. The wind
bloweth where it listeth. And one must submit to the
processes of one’s day. Personally, I have no belief in the
vast public. I believe that only the winnowed few can
care. But publishers, like thistle, must set innumerable
seeds on the wind, knowing most will miscarry.</p>

<p>To the vast public, the autumn morning is only a sort
of stage background against which they can display their
own mechanical importance. But to some men still the
trees stand up and look around at the daylight, having
woven the two ends of darkness together into visible
being and presence. And soon, they will let go the two
ends of darkness again, and disappear. A flower laughs
once, and having had his laugh, chuckles off into seed, and
is gone. Whence? Whither? Who knows, who cares?
That little laugh of achieved being is all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>So it is with books. To every man who struggles with
his own soul in mystery, a book that is a book flowers
once, and seeds, and is gone. First editions or forty-first
are only the husks of it.</p>

<p>Yet if it amuses a man to save the husks of the flower
that opened once for the first time, one can understand
that too. It is like the costumes that men and women
used to wear, in their youth, years ago, and which now
stand up rather faded in museums. With a jolt they reassemble
for us the day-to-day actuality of the by-gone
people, and we see the trophies once more of man’s eternal
fight with inertia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>This book, a record of the published writings of
Mr. D. H. Lawrence, follows the general plan of
the <i>Centaur Bibliographies</i> which have preceded it.
The opening section contains collations of the first issues
of Mr. Lawrence’s books, twenty-seven in all. Among
these collations is that of <i>Movements in European History</i>,
a book written by Mr. Lawrence, published under
the <i>nom de plume</i> Lawrence H. Davison, and never heretofore
openly attributed to him. Many of the collations
are accompanied by notes. Some of these discuss bibliographical
points which could not be adequately covered
in the more technical descriptions of the books; others
estimate the relative scarcity of the various items, or give
information about interesting editions after the first; a
few are critical.</p>

<p>Since ten of Mr. Lawrence’s books were first published
in America, some consistent method had to be found for
ranking the American “firsts” of an English author. The
plan adopted for this work was to list the first publication
of each book, regardless of place of publication, as the
real first edition of that book. It was difficult to escape
the logic and common-sense of this solution of a vexing
problem. But because the whimseys, prejudices, and sentiments
of book-collectors are often notoriously free from
logical or sensible restraints, all of the first English editions
of Mr. Lawrence are fully described, even though some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of them appeared months after the corresponding American
editions.</p>

<p>Preceding each collation, the year, the month, and, in
important instances, the day of publication are given.
This information, for the American books, was supplied
especially by Mr. B. W. Huebsch and Mr. Thomas Seltzer.
Similar information about the English books was
received from Mr. Lawrence’s London publishers, but
only in part; in the main, the year and the month of publication
were taken from the <i>English Catalogue of Books</i>.
Information from this source does not always agree absolutely
with publishers’ records; but it was usually accepted
as sufficiently accurate, since the month of publication at
least is oftener a nice refinement in a bibliography than a
significant fact. So much for the first section of this study.</p>

<p>The other sections are: Translation; Contributions to
Books; Contributions to Periodicals; Studies and Reviews.
All but the first of these require some special comment.</p>

<p>In cataloguing Mr. Lawrence’s writings every reasonable
effort was made (with what success cannot now be
told) to insure a complete record of his numerous and
varied contributions to books. In this business it is plainly
impossible to be sure that some items have not been overlooked.
Without in the least attempting to disarm criticism,
one may properly call attention to the great difficulty
of running down anthologies of modern poetry and prose,
to the making of which there seems, indeed, to be no end.
Added to this is the even greater difficulty of ascertaining
what these anthologies contain, without examining each
one separately. There simply isn’t an index of modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
collections of poetry. And indices of the short story leave
much to be discovered elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, under Contributions to Books are listed
some thirty volumes with Lawrence material. They are
treated in two ways: the books which contain Lawrence
“first printings between boards” are fully described and
annotated; those which include reprintings only are not
described, but the extent and the source of Mr. Lawrence’s
contributions to them are noted. The former are genuine
Lawrence items and should be in a comprehensive collection
of his writings.</p>

<p>In the fourth section of this study will be found an
approximately complete record of Mr. Lawrence’s contributions
to periodicals. These contributions are not, everything
considered, numerous. There are reasons for this.
It has not been Mr. Lawrence’s custom to publish novels
serially. He is not a voluminous writer of short stories,
contenting himself, evidently, with being a great one. He
has never been much given to reviewing, or to any other
sort of hack-writing. Plainly, these are not Mr. Lawrence’s
ways of keeping the pot boiling.</p>

<p>But numerous or not, the contributions to periodicals
are often of great interest—even for reasons unrelated
to technical bibliography. For example, many American
reviewers of <i>Studies in Classic American Literature</i>, published
August, 1923, were bewildered by what they considered
a surprise attack along our Parnassian front.
Others, less alarmed but scarcely more informed, found a
direct connection between the book and Mr. Lawrence’s
visits to our shores in 1922 and 1923. “Obviously,” they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
seemed to reason, “the author of this volume came to
<i>These States</i> for a first-hand view of our literary shrines,
and here is the critical account of his pilgrimage.” All
very interesting, if true. In point of fact, long before
1923 many of the studies, in their first forms, lay quietly
inurned, but recoverable, in the files of the <i>English Review</i>.
The earliest study goes back to November, 1918,
and most of the others followed hard upon the first.</p>

<p>There is, too, something for the collector among the
contributions to periodicals. Items of particular interest
to him are commented upon. In this connection, a special
effort was made to list the Lawrence material in out-of-the-way
magazines. Some of this sort to which Mr. Lawrence
contributed were, alas, not long for this hard world.
<i>The Blue Review</i>, <i>The Signature</i>, and <i>The Seven Arts</i>
are typical examples of such ephemera.</p>

<p>Although perhaps a majority of Mr. Lawrence’s contributions
to periodicals were subsequently used in certain
of his works, many remain uncollected. The notes which
follow the separate items will usually enable the curious
to distinguish the collected from the uncollected. They
will also show that Mr. Lawrence often altered the titles
of poems and stories before including them in his books.
But there the notes stop. No consistent effort was made
to deal with the larger phase of Mr. Lawrence’s textual
revisions. That lies outside the scope of this volume.
However, a comparison, say, of the stories in <i>The Prussian
Officer</i> with their first published forms will show that
Mr. Lawrence’s revisions go much beyond titles.</p>

<p>Regarding the chronological lists of Studies and Reviews<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
little need be said—except perhaps in apology. They do
not, strictly, belong in a volume of this sort, but were
finally included for whatever value they might have as an
index to the critical comment on Mr. Lawrence’s writings
since the publication of <i>The White Peacock</i>. The lists
make no claim to completeness. Nevertheless, they are
probably more inclusive than they should be. Along with
much that is fine, they contain much that is pointless and
futile. But this is not surprising: the average critic sitting
in judgment of Mr. Lawrence is quickly <i>au bout de
son latin</i>.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the general plan of this bibliographical
study. Designed primarily to meet the needs of Lawrence
collectors, it will also be serviceable to students of what is
now the most brilliant and challenging career in really
contemporary English literature. And it may have a
further use. Although Mr. Lawrence is quite without
the sort of pride in authorship that busies itself with shapes
of books or records of publications, he may nevertheless
find in this glorified card-index some usefulness. If so, I
shall be repaid for the making of it.</p>

<p>And now a word of thanks for help on this book must
go especially to Mr. Lawrence, to Mr. Harold T. Mason,
to Mr. David Jester, Jr., and to Mr. Carroll Frey.
Mr. Lawrence first told me about <i>Movements in European
History</i>, and he has generously forwarded my work
in other ways. The intrepid publishers of this volume
made it possible for me to examine duplicates of the various
Lawrence items, and Mr. Mason’s knowledge of the
investiture of the books herein described was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
drawn upon. Mr. Frey helped with the typography—which
in a book like the present is no small matter. I am
also indebted to a number of people, both in England and
America, for replies to many sorts of questions.</p>

<p>An appropriate conclusion to this introduction would
be, I have no doubt, a solemn recital of the General Confession.
But there’s no good here prating of things done
or left undone. There simply isn’t. Bibliolatry has its
virtues, but sweet charity is not among them. Indeed
she’s not. All this by way of letting the users of this book
know that reports of my sins of omission and commission
will be received with true stoical fortitude.</p>

<p><i>The White Peacock</i>, Mr. Lawrence’s first book, was
published by William Heinemann from plates imported
from Duffield and Company, New York. The omission
of the English printer’s imprint was, however, accidental,
not intentional. The exact date of the publication of the
English edition was January 20, 1911, while that of the
American issue was January 19. It is evident, therefore,
that <i>The White Peacock</i> was meant to appear simultaneously
in England and America. The book was, of course,
manufactured late in 1910, and copyright proceedings
were begun in both countries in this year, which is, in
fact, given in the copyright notice in the American book.</p>

<p>The first binding order on the English <i>White Peacock</i>,
I am informed by William Heinemann, Ltd., was for 750
copies. The second binding order was for a like number.
The two bindings differ on one point. The first has a
blind stamp of the Heinemann device, the wind-mill, on
the back cover; the second has not. However, both
“cases,” which are otherwise alike, contain the first printed
sheets. The inadvertent omission of the stamp from the
second binding is the sort of variation which often occurs
when the same sheets are bound at different times.</p>

<p>Copies of the first edition of <i>The White Peacock</i> are
now genuinely scarce. The book is seldom listed in catalogues,
where later Lawrence items are usually to be
found. It is well known that certain books of comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
recent publication tend, for one reason or another,
to disappear. These are often first books, the initial editions
of which are seldom large. <i>The White Peacock</i>, a
notable first novel, is a good example of this tendency. I
believe that the Heinemann <i>White Peacock</i> is as scarce
as the Methuen <i>Rainbow</i>, universally regarded as the rarest
Lawrence item. Certain it is that I have seen more
copies of <i>The Rainbow</i> in fine condition than I have seen
of <i>The White Peacock</i> in any condition.</p>

<p>Collectors who have a copy of this book, and who are
curious about Mr. Lawrence’s comment on the textual
change made after the sheets were bound, will probably
find a tipped-in leaf at pages 229 and 230. I have examined
only four copies. All of these had the inserted leaf.
I suspect the bowdlerizing was efficient and thorough, but
I cannot, under the circumstances, be sure. However, in
connection with this textual change appears my reason for
including a collation of the American first edition of this
book. The Duffield text is unaltered, as a comparison of
the English and American editions of 1911 will show.</p>

</div>

<p>Crown 8vo, 7¼ × 4⅞; issued in dark blue cloth; front cover
has, at top and bottom only, thick line border, with thin
inner line—both in blind; and inside of gilt circle at
center is lettered in gilt as follows: <i>The</i> / <i>Trespasser</i> /

/ <i>Duckworth</i> / (one thin, one thick line at bottom).
Back cover has at center blind stamp of publishers’ device,
but is otherwise blank. All edges cut. End-papers white.</p>

<p>Dealers in modern first editions call <i>The Trespasser</i> a
“hard” book. It <i>is</i> scarce, but the dealers protest too
much. Surely they are not correct in assuming, as they
frequently do, that <i>The Trespasser</i> is as scarce as the
Heinemann <i>White Peacock</i>, even if good copies of it are
difficult to come by—as they certainly are.</p>

<p>Although the above is the genuine first issue of <i>The Trespasser</i>,
there are extant copies identical with it on the
inside, but in a light green “case,” lettered on the front in
black and on the backbone in gilt—except <i>Duckworth</i>,
which is in black. The curious who have at hand a first
edition of Mr. W. H. Davies’ <i>Beggars</i>, also published by
Duckworth, will know the cover-design of <i>The Trespasser</i>
in green. The texture and the color of the cloths
differ somewhat. I know nothing about this unusual
form, except that the copy I have is on the inside, page for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
page, identical with the above. One other copy has been
reported to me, by Mr. Arthur Rogers, an English dealer.</p>

<p>The publishers (their file copies of <i>The Trespasser</i> having
disappeared) are a bit vague, but they suggest that
perhaps copies for the Colonial market were bound in
green. This may be the answer; but since the green
“case” is certainly more elaborate, and was probably
more expensive than the blue, one suspects the former
may have been a “trial” binding.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>The Trespasser</i> was published,
from the Duckworth sheets, by Mitchell Kennerley,
New York, 1912.</p>

<p><i>Love Poems and Others</i> was Mr. Lawrence’s third book,
and his first volume of poetry. As to the comparative
scarcity of this first edition opinion differs greatly. Of
the six books of poems (not counting <i>Bay</i>, a private press
volume) by Mr. Lawrence, I am inclined to rank <i>Love
Poems</i> third in scarcity. I suspect that both <i>Amores</i> (first
issue, with the catalogue) and <i>Look! We Have Come
Through!</i> are scarcer than this item. Be that as it may,
<i>Love Poems</i> is far from common. Fortunately, however,
the book was stoutly built, and copies of the first edition,
when they do turn up, are usually in quite satisfactory condition—satisfactory
even to collectors.</p>

<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i>, now universally acclaimed one of the
great novels of recent years, appeals strongly to many collectors
who go in for modern first editions. The significance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of the book was realized soon after its publication,
and copies of the initial printing were evidently read,
passed around, and reread. As a result, copies of this edition
in excellent state are now seldom seen. Most show
signs of hard use. Nevertheless, all Lawrence collectors
entertain the hope of having some fine day an <i>editio
princeps</i> of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> in what they can superciliously
call “pristine condition.” The incorrigibly optimistic
want even the original dust-cover.</p>

<p>While waiting for this perfect copy, some collectors may
do well to make sure that their present copies are of the
first issue; for <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is rather a tricky item. A
later issue in lighter blue cloth, without date on title-page,
must not be confused with the real first issue described
above, the cloth of which is an unusual dark blue—somewhat
lighter than navy blue.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> was published,
from new plates, by Mitchell Kennerley, New
York, 1913.</p>

<p>The first of Mr. Lawrence’s two published plays. It is
not generally realized that the American issue of <i>The
Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd</i> preceded the English, which
was, as a matter of fact, made from the Kennerley sheets.
A not overly close examination of a Duckworth copy of
this book will show that the fly-leaf with the series-title,
etc. on recto, was cut out after the sheets had been sewed
together. This accounts for the slight difference in the
pagination of the two editions. Then, also, the matter on
the reverse side of the Duckworth title-page clearly indicates
that all of the sheets were American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The first edition of <i>The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd</i> was
one thousand copies. Five hundred of these were sent to
Duckworth and Company, and were by this house bound
in the dark blue “case” described below. There is no
certain way of telling which of the two books is the
scarcer; but I should not be surprised to find that copies
of the American issue are the harder to come by—at
least, in good state. The English book still performs the
trick of turning up over here in quite new condition.</p>

<p><i>The Prussian Officer</i> was Mr. Lawrence’s first volume
of short stories. The first edition of this book exists in
two several issues. The difference between them is
marked, not by the binding, but by the catalogues at the
end of the volumes. One of these catalogues is described
above; the other, twenty instead of sixteen pages, is: <i>A
Selection from</i> / <i>Duckworth &amp; Co’s.</i> / <i>List of Publications</i></p>

<p>The publishers were unable to say which catalogue was
in the first issue, and showed what amounted to alarm
that anyone should be interested in the matter. They
evidently regarded their correspondent as mildly insane.
Publishers are of two varieties: the sort who understand
the collector not at all, and the sort who understand him
too, too well.</p>

<p>I have examined five copies of the book. All but one had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the catalogue mentioned in this note. What deduction
may safely be made from this? Perhaps, that copies of
the issue which I have collated are the scarcer. But are
they also necessarily the earlier? One may well have
doubts about that.</p>

<p>A somewhat detailed study of the two types of catalogues
in Duckworth books between 1913 and 1916 is unfruitful,
except to show that the catalogue mentioned in this
discussion occurs in <i>Sons and Lovers</i> (1913), and that in
the collation above appears in <i>Amores</i> (1916). But
since the latter list seems to contain no book published
after 1914, it might properly occupy space in a volume
brought out in December of that year. The question of
the real first issue of <i>The Prussian Officer</i> must, therefore,
remain unsettled. One thing is certain: both books
here discussed are of the first edition. A later issue, in
somewhat lighter blue cloth, lettered in black, must not
be confused with either.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>The Prussian Officer</i> was
published, from the Duckworth sheets, by B. W. Huebsch,
New York, 1916.</p>

<p><i>The Rainbow</i>, universally considered by dealers and collectors
alike Mr. Lawrence’s scarcest book, was published,
according to <i>The English Catalogue</i>, in October, 1915.
The publishers, however, said that the exact date of issue
was September 30, 1915. And with that they stopped,
for they seemed unwilling to give me any more information
about the book. Altogether wry was the letter they
wrote. But from other sources it is evident that <i>The
Rainbow</i> was in circulation just six weeks before action
for its suppression was successfully carried on November<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
13, 1915. The curious may consult a communication
by G. W. de Tunzelmann, published in the <i>Athenæum</i>,
November 20, 1915, which, if accurate, fixes the date of
suppression.</p>

<p>Regarding the circumstances attending the action against
the publishers, a letter by Mr. Gilbert Cannan, New
York <i>Tribune</i>, January 10, 1920, is worth reading. Mr.
Cannan asserts that after proceedings were brought “the
publishers, taking alarm and not understanding what had
happened, did not defend.” This is substantially what
Mr. Lawrence says in his preface to the present volume.
The upshot of it was the publishers were fined and
ordered to destroy their stock of the book, after which,
one may suppose, all went “on with the War.” Whether
such copies as the publishers had on hand were committed
to the tender mercies of the public hangman, I do not
know. At any rate, it may be safely assumed that Methuen
&amp; Co., Ltd., complied fully with every mandate of
the court, and that they distributed no copies of <i>The
Rainbow</i> after November 13, 1915.</p>

<p>In his preface above Mr. Lawrence mentions the protests
of Mr. Arnold Bennett and Miss May Sinclair against
the suppression of <i>The Rainbow</i>. I regret my inability to
give specific references to the time and place of these
protests. But all indices failed me, and both Mr. Bennett
and Miss Sinclair wrote that they could not now tell
me where to look for their parts in the controversy. Both
wrote against the suppression, but apparently in letters—not
in special articles. In her reply to my inquiry Miss
Sinclair gave this indication of her position: “I said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the suppression of this book was a crime, the murder of a
beautiful thing.”</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>The Rainbow</i> was published,
from new plates, by B. W. Huebsch, New York,
1916. Subsequently Mr. Huebsch brought the book out
in a more expensive form, but the text remained the same
as that of the first American edition. These are the expurgated
forms to which Mr. Lawrence refers. <i>The
Rainbow</i>, with the Huebsch text, was published by Thomas
Seltzer, New York, 1924.</p>

<p>It will be seen from all this that the complete text of the
novel which lies so close to the affections of its author is
to be found only in copies like the one collated above.
The Methuen <i>Rainbow</i> is, I need hardly say, a very scarce
book. Whether or not it is scarcer than the Heinemann
<i>White Peacock</i> must remain a matter of opinion.</p>

<p><i>Twilight in Italy</i> was Mr. Lawrence’s first book of non-fictional
prose. Copies of the first edition of this book are
scarce, and they are exceedingly hard to get in fine condition.
The cloth is usually faded and the gilt dull. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
have seen at various times perhaps a half-dozen copies.
They were all very much the same: that is to say, none
was in fine state. I suspect the book never looked quite
new, and that it is one of the many illustrations of how
the War affected adversely workmanship in the bookmaking
industry. Be that as it may, <i>Twilight in Italy</i> is
worth having in any condition. It should be more widely
read. Like <i>Sea and Sardinia</i>, it is too often merely a
name, even to admirers of Mr. Lawrence’s other work.</p>

<p><i>Amores</i>, Mr. Lawrence’s second volume of poems, is a
troublesome item. The first edition exists in two states.
The first has the 16-page catalogue; the second does not.
At no place in either issue is there a date. Copies with
the catalogue would seem to be rare. At least I have so
concluded after a sustained investigation. Copies without
the catalogue are “easy,” and these are commonly sold—perhaps
naturally enough—as of the first issue, which
they are not.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>Amores</i> was published, from
new plates, by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1916. At
least two differences between it and the above ought to be
noted. First, in the American edition the dedication is
extended, and reads: <i>To</i> / <i>Ottoline Morrell</i> / <i>in tribute</i>
/ <i>to her noble</i> / <i>and independent sympathy</i> / <i>and her generous
understanding</i> / <i>these poems</i> / <i>are gratefully dedicated</i>
/ . Second, the poem called “Disagreeable Advice” in
the above, appears in the American edition under the happier
title “Irony.”</p>

<p>The first edition of <i>New Poems</i> was printed on what
must have been almost the worst of all possible war-time
paper; and since, in addition, the book lacked the security
of a substantial “case,” I suspect this item will before long
become scarce.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>New Poems</i> was published,
from new plates, by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1920.
This edition, too, has an interest for the Lawrence collector;
it contains a significant prefatory essay, which is not
in the English issue, and which, Mr. Lawrence says,
“should have come as a preface to <i>Look! We Have Come
Through!</i>” This “Preface” is notable for its lucid and
brilliant comment on the nature of poetry. One finds Mr.
Lawrence recurring to some of the tenets here expressed,
when on those too few later occasions he has commented
on the poetry of others, more especially on that of Whitman.
This essay first appeared in <i>The Playboy</i>, Numbers
4-5 (not dated), under the title “The Poetry of the
Present.”</p>

<p>The “tall, blue <i>Women in Love</i>.” In this form Mr.
Lawrence’s most significant and most characteristic novel
had its first restricted circulation. Copies of this issue
are not very scarce. Just why is difficult to say. Perhaps
the edition was not fully bought up (however much it
deserved to be) when the novel was published in a cheaper
form by Mr. Seltzer, October, 1922.</p>

<p>A few (less than twenty-five) copies of this form of
<i>Women in Love</i> were autographed, on the title-page, by
Mr. Lawrence. These signed copies were the first numbered,
and except for the signature, are identical with the

<p>This small edition of <i>Women in Love</i> was done by Martin
Secker, who imported the sheets for it from America.
These sheets were the same as those printed for item 14,
which was, of course, brought out by Thomas Seltzer, but
without his imprint.</p>

<p>Except for size, copies of this edition of <i>Women in Love</i>
are uniform with the Secker format of Mr. Lawrence’s
novels, beginning with <i>The Lost Girl</i> and followed by the
ordinary <i>Women in Love</i> described immediately above.</p>

<p>Before the Seltzer sheets were put into the Secker “case,”
they were trimmed about five-sixteenths of an inch at the
top by the English binders. This accounts for the slightly
greater height of the copies in the blue “case.” I mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
this because the signed copies in brown are sometime
described as the tall-paper copies. Obviously any such
description of the Secker book needs qualifying. All this
may be summed up as follows: all forms of the “1920”
issues of <i>Women in Love</i>, whether signed or not, whether
bound in blue or brown, were from the sheets of the Seltzer
privately printed edition. To this summary may be
appended the following observations: (1) these “1920”
forms constitute the real first printing of <i>Women in Love</i>;
(2) this is one of the two books which Mr. Lawrence has
thus far signed—and the only novel.</p>

Top and fore edges cut; bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers

<p>The first edition of <i>The Lost Girl</i> exists in three states.
These are: first, that which has the text exactly as Mr.
Lawrence first wrote it; second, that which has the original
text altered, the alterations occurring on two cancel-leaves,
which, tipped-in, replaced two leaves with the
original matter; third, that which has the altered pages
not tipped-in, but as integral parts of the signatures to
which they belong.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that any changes were made in
the text of <i>The Lost Girl</i> after the book had been printed,
but such is the case. These textual changes were made on
pages 256 and 268, and necessitated tipped-in leaves at
those places in the book. The cancel-leaves have been
held, by a few careful dealers, to mark the real first issue.
To most dealers this “point” is evidently unknown. Mr.
Martin Secker, answering my inquiry about the changes
in this book, wrote as follows: “The explanation of the
tipped-in pages in <i>The Lost Girl</i> is that it was thought
expedient to make certain verbal alterations in the text, a
decision which was come to after the book was printed.
As far as I know, all copies of the English edition in circulation
are like this.”</p>

<p>This letter would seem to justify anyone in assuming that
copies with the tipped-in leaves were of the first issue.
But, as a matter of fact, copies with the original text are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
extant. At least one such copy has fallen into my hands.
It came from an English dealer through the Centaur
Book Shop. I have neither seen nor have I heard of another
such copy. But that some few more are in circulation
is likely. In any case this is certain: the unaltered
form of <i>The Lost Girl</i> is a scarce book, perhaps even a
rare one. So much for the first and second states.</p>

<p>Regarding the third state, little need be said. One might
be justified in reporting it as a second printing; but since
there is nothing in the book to indicate a complete reprinting,
it seemed better to regard it as one form of the first
edition, as I have done.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>The Lost Girl</i>, which has
the altered text, was published, from new plates, by Thomas
Seltzer, New York, 1921.</p>

<p><i>Movements in European History</i>, written by Mr. Lawrence
and published under the <i>nom de plume</i> Lawrence
H. Davison, is in effect an elementary textbook on the
history of continental Europe from the beginning of the
Christian era to the unification of Germany. But it is
more than that. To say that the book is alive, that it
interprets rather than catalogues historical events, that it
deals with these events frankly rather than cautiously,
that it is written with spirit and can be read with pleasure,
and, finally, to assert that nowhere about the book does
one smell pedagogy, is to say in a variety of ways that
<i>Movements in European History</i> is very much more than
an elementary textbook.</p>

<p>The initial edition of this interesting item exists in two
forms. The first is described above; the second differs
from the first in that it has a light brown binding, all
other points being identical. The initial printing was
exhausted the first year, and the book was reprinted in
1922. Both first forms differ in several ways from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
reprint, which has, on the verso of an undated title-page,
a line of type as follows: <i>First published 1921; reprinted
1922</i></p>

<p>At the time this note is written (late September, 1924)
plans are on foot to reissue <i>Movements</i> with an epilogue
and illustrations. The former will presumably bring the
story of European history down to the present. In its
new form, as in its old, the book will in England bear the
imprint of the Oxford University Press.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>Movements in European
History</i> will probably be published next spring, with Mr.
Lawrence’s authorship acknowledged, by Thomas Seltzer,
New York.</p>

<p>The American edition of <i>Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
which was the first, exists in two forms. I collated
both the so-called “Special Issue” and the ordinary edition
because I know that many collectors, as well as some dealers,
have been puzzled about the first forms of this book.
A comparison of items 17 and 17A will show that the two
forms of the first edition of <i>Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious</i>
differ in the following respects: first, the “Special
Issue” has a certificate of issue on the verso of the half-title,
but is on the inside otherwise identical with the ordinary
form—even to the broken U on page nine, in the
word “Unconscious;” second, the sheets of the “Special
Issue” measure 7⅜ × 5, while those of the ordinary issue
measure 7⁵⁄₁₆ × 5; third, in keeping with this difference,
perhaps, the outside measurements of the “Special Issue”
are slightly larger all around; fourth, the boards of the
two forms are different in color; fifth, the lettering on the
“Special Issue” is darker than that on the ordinary copies.</p>

<p>Just why the “Special Issue” was done is not exactly clear.
Perhaps some plans with regard to it miscarried, and the
idea of a real limited edition was given up. At any rate
the five copies of the book I examined were all unnumbered,
and the original price on them was that of the
regular edition. It is not too much to say the limited
“Special Issue” of <i>Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious</i> is
freakish rather than any thing else. It is a collector’s item.</p>

<p>After the first edition of this book had been exhausted,
Mr. Seltzer issued the second printing in a more substantial
“case,” that is to say, in cloth, in which form it is
now available. It will be noticed from the collations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
above that the first American edition preceded the corresponding
English edition by more than two years.</p>

<p>In spite of all that critics have said or may say about <i>Psychoanalysis
and the Unconscious</i> and its successor, <i>Fantasia
of the Unconscious</i>, one thing is clearly incontrovertible.
It is this: both of these books, especially the latter,
reveal flashes of illumination, such as are found in imaginative
thought—and nowhere else.</p>

<p>Small medium 8vo, 9 × 6; issued in old gold boards; front
cover has picture in many colors; in right of foreground
giant tortoise is suspended, in framework of heavy timbers,
by rope around his middle; in the middle-ground and
background, showing through heavy-timbered frame, is one
of Hiroshige’s views of Fujiyama, the whole being a reproduction
of a print by this artist; front cover lettered
in black in imitation Chinese lettering as follows: <i>Tortoises</i>
/ <i>by</i> / <i>D. H. Lawrence</i> Backbone has white paper
title-and-name label lettered in black: (vertical line) <i>Tortoises—D.
H. Lawrence</i> (vertical line). Back cover
blank. Top edges cut; fore edges uncut and unopened;
bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.</p>

<p>This is the first and only separate edition of <i>Tortoises</i>,
which book has never been published in single-volume form
in England. Its first appearance there between boards
was in <i>Birds, Beasts and Flowers</i>, where it occupies pages
117-138. Although this item is still easy to come by,
Lawrence collectors who haven’t it will do well to get
copies soon. Already English catalogues list <i>Tortoises</i> at
a price considerably in advance of the American publication
price. Naturally the book is less common in England
than here.</p>

<p><i>Sea and Sardinia</i> was Mr. Lawrence’s second volume of
travel sketches—only “travel” and “sketches” are not
quite the words needed here. In any case, a glorious book.
Something will be gained if all persons ignorant of <i>Sea
and Sardinia</i> (and <i>Twilight in Italy</i>) stop pretending to
a full knowledge of Mr. Lawrence’s prose. Because the
book has nowhere had the reading it deserves, the first
issues of <i>Sea and Sardinia</i>, both American and English,
are still relatively easy to get.</p>

<p><i>England, My England</i> was Mr. Lawrence’s second volume
of short stories. It came almost eight years after the
first. However, the long interval between <i>The Prussian
Officer</i> and this second collection would seem to have less
significance in his career as a writer of short stories than
some reviewers of <i>England, My England</i> tried to make
out. At any rate, the title story of the latter volume appeared
in the <i>English Review</i> in October, 1915, and
some of the other stories were published several years
before their appearance in book form. All this as may be,
<i>England, My England</i> is a Lawrence item of great importance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>

<p><i>Studies in Classic American Literature</i> is, so far, Mr.
Lawrence’s only sustained work in literary criticism.
Many of these essays first appeared serially in the <i>English
Review</i>. The dates of their appearance in that journal
are given under Contributions to Periodicals, where a
paper on Whitman in the London <i>Nation</i> is also noted.
Before their publication in book form the essays were
materially revised, and several new studies were added.</p>

<p>To this volume, the first of three <i>Imagist Anthologies</i>
published by the Houghton Mifflin Company, Mr. Lawrence
contributed seven poems as follows: “Ballad of
Another Ophelia;” “Illicit;” “Fireflies in the Corn;”
“A Woman and Her Dead Husband;” “The Mowers;”
“Scent of Irises;” “Green.” These poems occupy pages
67 to 78. The first and sixth appeared later in <i>Amores</i>.
The second, third, fifth, and seventh were included in
<i>Look! We Have Come Through!</i> But, “The Mowers,”
revised, was here printed under the title “A Youth Mowing,”
and “Illicit” became “On a Balcony.” “A Woman
and Her Dead Husband” is, in <i>New Poems</i>, “The Bitterness
of Death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>Because the contributors to the <i>Imagist Anthologies</i> had
agreed among themselves to submit nothing that had previously
appeared in book form, these collections are of
especial interest to collectors of Mr. Lawrence’s first printings
in books.</p>

<p>The <i>Imagist Anthologies</i> were published in England by
Constable and Company, but after the American editions,
which were the first.</p>

<p>To the second <i>Imagist Anthology</i> Mr. Lawrence contributed
five poems: “Erinnyes;” “Perfidy;” “At the
Window;” “In Trouble and Shame;” “Brooding Grief.”
These poems occupy pages 67-74. All but “Erinnyes,”
most beautiful of war poems, were later included in
<i>Amores</i>. Any one of the many anthologies of war poetry
might have enriched itself greatly by including “Erinnyes.”
If any such collection did make use of this poem, I am unaware
of it.</p>

<p>To this representative collection of modern verse, prose,

So far as I am aware neither of these poems has been
reprinted in any of Mr. Lawrence’s books of poems. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
likely that the edition of <i>New Paths</i> was small, for this
book has already become scarce—at least for an anthology.</p>

<p>An American edition of <i>New Paths</i> was published by
Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1918.</p>

<p>A note must suffice to describe this very beautiful anthology
of English and French verse, prose, woodcuts, etchings,
etc. The edition of <i>The New Keepsake</i> was limited
to 620 copies for general distribution; 50 copies on Japanese
vellum, numbered from 1 to 50; 20 copies on blue
vellum, numbered from 51 to 70; 550 copies on hand-made
paper, numbered from 71 to 620. The blue vellum
copies were bound in black buckram, lettered in pink;
those on hand-made paper were done in yellow buckram,
lettered in black. I have not seen a copy of this book on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Japanese vellum. Copies on this and blue vellum are, in
the nature of things, now very scarce; but the cheapest
form of the book can still be bought from dealers at a
nominal advance over publication price, which was 18s. 6d.</p>

<p>“Adolf,” Mr. Lawrence’s contribution to <i>The New Keepsake</i>,
occupies pages 19-33. It is a beautiful story—one
which should certainly find a place in some future collection
of his shorter pieces. “Adolf” was published in the
<i>Dial</i>, September, 1920.</p>

<p>Three volumes of <i>The New Decameron</i>, an interesting

To the third of these volumes Mr. Lawrence contributed
one of the greatest of his short stories—“Wintry

<p class="smaller">* The notes in this section, so far as they assign or do not
assign the various contributions to Mr. Lawrence’s books, must
be understood to refer to titles rather than to the selections
themselves. No consistent effort has been made to ascertain
how many of the unassigned contributions appear in the books
under new titles. Some do so appear and are noted, but my
knowledge of them is the result of casual reading rather than
deliberate investigation.</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
